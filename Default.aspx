                 <strong>The Blood Bank system requires a lot of procedures to organize and store blood products, Typically, each donated unit of blood (whole blood) is separated into multiple components, such as red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Each component is generally transfused to a different individual, each with different needs.
The main problem of the blood bank system is the huge and accurate consequence information resulting from the process of removing a specific component of the blood, such as platelets, and returning the remaining components, such as red blood cells and plasma, to the donor. This process allows more of one part of the blood to be collected than could be separated from a unit of whole blood. Apheresis is also performed to collect plasma (the liquid part of the blood) and granulocytes (white blood cells).
The second main problem of blood bank system is when the donation process is done manually without an electronic system to manage the donor registration, donor medical history, donor medical mini-physical and donor personal contact information.
The third main problem of blood bank system is the non-available blood group request, manual blood bank management system cannot take or keep any blood request, that because of the lack of modern database systems.</strong>
